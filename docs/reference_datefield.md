The `<date-field>` element represents a single-line input field. When pressed, the field focuses and shows a widget to enter in a valid date. The exact behavior depends on the platform:

- on Android, `<date-field>` uses the system date picker modal
- on iOS `<date-field>` shows a date spinner in a bottom sheet
