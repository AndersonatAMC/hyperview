# React Native Hyperview Client

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Instawork/hyperview.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Instawork/hyperview)

This is a React Native-based implementation of a Hyperview Client, meant to be integrated into an existing React Native app. 

See the [Hyperview website](https://hyperview.org) for more information about Hyperview and Hyperview XML.

## Requirements
- React Native 0.55+
- React Native Navigation 2.X+

## Getting Started
> TODO

## Running the example server
The [examples](/examples) directory contains examples of Hyperview screens and interactions. To access the examples, run
```
yarn test:xmlserver
```
This will start an HTTP server listening on port 8085. It simply serves files from the `./examples` directory.
